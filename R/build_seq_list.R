#' Function to process species-specific sequence data and generate the seqs and seqList objects
#' @description Function using path to a fasta file or seqs dataframe to generate the seqs and seqList objects needed by Regmex to evaluate motif counts and sequence-specific probabilities, and saves the objects as independent .rds files. To obtain sequences from bioMart, please see the tutorial provided as part of the miReact package (https://github.com/muhligs/miReact/blob/master/makingUtrsForAdditionalSpecies.pdf).
#'
#' @param seq_in character or dataframe, path to a bioMart output (decompressed .fasta file) or a dataframe containing gene_name/gene_IDs, sequences and sequence lengths.
#' @param out_path character, path to save seqs and seqList objects as .rds files. Default is current working directory.
#' @param gene_id character specifying the gene ID that should be used (this HAS to match the IDs in the gene/transcript expression matrix). The input can be "gsym" (gene symbol, default), "gid" (ensembl gene id), "tid" (ensembl transcript id). Only relevant to specify when using a bioMart file as input.
#' @param min_length integer, minimum sequence length to include in the seqs object. Default is 20.
#' @param max_length integer, maximum sequence length to include in the seqs object. Default is 10,000.
#' @param one_seq_per_gene_id logical, if TRUE (default) only the longest sequence per gene will be included in the seqs object if a FASTA file is provided. Setting this parameter to FALSE is relevant when considering multiple transcripts per gene or when performing manual filtering of sequences.
